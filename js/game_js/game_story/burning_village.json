The villagers desperately pleaded for a reduction to the tax as it would mean they wouldn't be able to afford various things needed for their survival such as firewood and bread, but the knights are stubborn which led to them attacking the village as punishment for disrespecting the king. The knights laugh while destroying the village.\n\nWith nothing but a sword, a small healing potion, and some rations, you flee into the darkness, heading toward the capital in search of refuge.",
